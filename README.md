# Placepolar

Placeholder polarbears for web development in EF. Really rudimentary clone of `placekitten.com`


Go to: `<website>/photo/<width>/<height>/` to get a polar bear. Website name to be determined soon.

## NOTE: The polar bear pictures are not my own and they were taken from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/polar-bear). Please do support the photographers there if you like the photos. A bulk of them come from [Hans-Jurgen Mager](https://unsplash.com/@hansjurgen007)	

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
